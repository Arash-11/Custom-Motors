This project stems from my passion for automobiles.
The website contains very little custom Javascript as most of my focus was on the UI/UX, coloring, and styline side.

Please note, this site is optimized for the Chrome browser, so you will see some differences if you're using other browsers. For example,
I have used the ::-webkit-scrollbar CSS selector to style the scrollbar - this is only supported on Chrome currently.
